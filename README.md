# Digital-Clock
## v0.1.1 dev
Hello!
This is my first ever repository in my GitHub account!
This is simply a small digital clock that shows you the time.

It is actually still under development and this is actually just a preview.
It is tested to work on Linux, It has (probably low) chances to work on Windows or on Darwin (which is Mac OS)


---INSTRUCTIONS---
You have to check and be sure if your system 
has got Python 3 or later installed. To do
that press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` to open your
terminal. Then execute `python -V` and this
will be your result: <br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114411616/194586320-63de1421-ab04-4b69-ad9e-4bb9951fd6bc.png)
<br>Then you have to run the thing through ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114411616/194620169-c826de61-bc29-46af-902b-b93fa5e08687.png)
<br> Then it will show you a brief intro. Next up is the input, which is the sentence you want to analyze... The limit is 4096 words or less.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114411616/194620723-dd041343-553d-4cef-95a7-05ed0b4b428c.png)
<br> It shows the character count, word count and also how many uppercase or lowercase occurrences there are.<br>
ENJOY!
